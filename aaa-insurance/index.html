				<h1 class="case-study-text">Improving <a href="https://aaa.com/" target="_blank">AAA's</a> Auto Insurance Quoter</h1>
				<p class="case-study-text">AAA's existing auto insurance quoting experience was outdated and offered a poor experience. We at <a href="http://www.pivotal.io" target="_blank">Pivotal</a> re-built the entire auto insurance quoting system from the ground up.</p>
			</div>
				<img src="AAA-screen-overview.png" />

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">Team</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">We had a large team that was assembled at Pivotal's HQ in San Francisco. AAA was matching each discipline, and we were eager to help them learn the design methodologies we practised. On the product side, there was a AAA product owner, 1 Pivotal product manager and 2 AAA business analysts. Engineering was staffed at 4 from each company. I led the design team with 1 training Pivotal designer and 2 AAA designers.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">Goal</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">We needed to release a fully functional re-design in 6 months to help grow revenue in this business sector. We started by narrowing our focus to AAA's primary insurance customer; drivers with high income and high standards for customer service.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">Diving Deeper</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">After the working through the major touchpoints in the insurance quoting process, we set out to do a mix of qualitiative and prototype testing with the existing web app. We spent 4 weeks talking to 2-4 customers a day. Like usual I used my <a href="https://builttoadapt.io/using-trello-for-user-research-synthesis-fb1abdfc7c4b" target="_blank">Trello research synthesis process</a>.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">Learnings</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">We learned that AAA customers spend 5-15 min in total getting an insurance quote. Everyone wants to see discounts applied. And most people don’t understand their coverage. So it was obvious we needed to dig deeper into coverages.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">Story Mapping to Priotize Work</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">I sat with one of the AAA designers to map out all the design work we had ahead, and then started creating a plan to prioritize the bigger groups of work.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">Iterating in Low Fidelity</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">We worked in Sketch and InVision, and tested with a small amount of users each week.</p>
				</div>

				<img src="low-fi-mobile.png" />

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">Increasing Fidelity</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">Over time we started to increase fidelity and bring in more of AAA's brand.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">Responsive System</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">We also created a reusable UI system that behaved well across all types of content and resolutions. The current state of AAA's other digital products had a lot of inconsistencies. We were setting the standard for UI moving forward.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">Designing for Complex States</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">We had to design scalable components that could adapt to a variety of inputs and states.</p>
				</div>

				<img src="calendar-component.gif" />

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">Collaborative Feedback</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">Sometimes stakeholders would join our weekly critique sessions. I'd often talk to our design decisions, and sometimes even iterate on them on the spot.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">“AAA Customers don’t understand their coverage choices, and how it impacts their monthly insurance payments.”</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">We believed that coverages were hard to understand during the quoting process. Displaying real-time $$ change with coverage options could be very helpful. Drivers also wanted to know how their coverage choices could change their monthly rate. But our biggest challenge was displaying quote changes without overwhelming drivers with detail.</p>
				</div>

				<img src="coverages-states-sketch.png" />

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">Simplifying Coverages</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">After iterating through all the possible scenarios for coverages changes, we came up with hide and show system that had extensible components for user selections. Since coverages vary by U.S state, this system needed to be very adaptable. We also came up a light and easy way to show quote changes through a price total animation.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="case-study-text-container">
					<h2 class="case-study-text">What We Accomplished</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">We were able to ship a brand new product in a short time frame, and helped AAA designers learn some lean design methodologies. On the downside, we were not able to learn from live metrics because AAA brought the team back in house.
