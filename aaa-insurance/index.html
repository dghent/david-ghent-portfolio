				<p class="case-study-text">AAA's legacy auto insurance quoting experience was outdated and provided a poor experience. We at <a href="http://www.pivotal.io" target="_blank">Pivotal</a> were tasked with re-building the entire auto insurance quoting system from the ground up.</p>

					<h2 class="case-study-text">Team</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">We had a large team that was assembled at Pivotal's HQ. AAA was matching each discipline, and we were eager to help them learn the learn methodologies we practised. On the product side, there was a AAA product owner, 1 Pivotal product Manager and 2 AAA business analysts. Engineering was stacked at 4 Pivotal engineers and 4 AAA engineers. I led the design team along with 1 training Pivotal designer and 2 AAA designers.</p>

					<h2 class="case-study-text">Goal</h2>
					<p class="case-study-text">We needed to release a fully functional re-design in 6 months to grow revenue. This accounted for a low % of AAA’s market share.</p>
