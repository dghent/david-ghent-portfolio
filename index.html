				<h2>Scoot Fleet App</h2>
				<p>My first initiative at Scoot was to improve the efficiency of field technicians. While in the field, they have a wide range of responsibilities to ensure there are as many shared electric vehicles available for Scoot's riders, as possible.

				<h2>Scoot Operations</h2>
				<p>To keep Scoot's shared electric vehicle network running, there are vehicle engineers, fleet supervisors, managers and customer service reps that are monitoring all vehicles for issues, and need to access various data and vehicle actions at any given time. Scoot's admin operations desktop experience allows users to do things like adjust a vehicle's firmware settings remotely, remove a vehicle from the public fleet, or create a list of vehicles in a specific state (like neededing maintenance) so that tasks can be created to resolve them.
