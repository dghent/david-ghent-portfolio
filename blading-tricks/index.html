                <p>A guide to most of the basic tricks you could learn as a new blader.

            <h2>Skate Diagram</h2>
            <p>Each part of the skate has a name. The parts labelled here are the main pieces used for grinding and should be a good reference for the description for each trick.</p>

          <div class="column">
            <img src="frontside.gif" loading="lazy" id="frontside">
            <h2>Frontside</h2>
            <p>Probably the best beginner trick to start with. Approach with speed and jump with both feet and land equally on the inner part of each <a href="#diagram">h-block</a>, with your legs a little wider than shoulder width apart.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="backside.gif" loading="lazy" id="backslide">
            <h2>Backside</h2>
            <p>Similar to a <a href="#frontside">frontside</a>, but slightly more difficult with the rail to your back. At first it might feel weird but it helps to practice by jumping on a curb, or another rough edge you won't slip off.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="royale.gif" loading="lazy" id="royale">
            <h2>Royale</h2>
            <p>Much like a <a href="#frontside">frontside</a>, but lean both your ankles backward. You'll find it's much easier to bend with your knees to get your <a href="#diagram">backslide plate</a> down on the rail. Make sure you lean forward a lot on the first few attempts otherwise you'll slip back.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="backside-royale.gif" loading="lazy" id="backside-royale">
            <h2>Backside Royale</h2>
            <p>Very similar to a <a href="#royale">frontside royale</a> but a bit more challenging since the rail is behind you. Remember to bend your knees to feel more comfortable bending your ankles on the <a href="#diagram">backslide plate</a></p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="frontside-full-torque.gif" loading="lazy" id="front-full-torque">
            <h2>Frontside Full Torque</h2>
            <p>Once you've mastered a <a href="#frontside">frontside</a> try leaning with the backslide plate in the front. It looks simple but can be challenging to keep your front foot leaning forward. Bend your knees to make it easier to lean your ankles. Also called front farv/fahrvergnügen.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

          <h2>Backside Full Torque</h2>
          <p>Similar to a <a href="#front-full-torque">frontside full torque</a>, but backside. Some find this much easier than the frontside version, some vice versa. Start with the one that's most comfortable to you and then work on the other. Also called back farv/fahrvergnügen.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="soul-grind.gif" loading="lazy" id="soul-grind">
            <h2>Soul Grind</h2>
            <p>A classic trick - easy to learn but hard to jump on with both feet at first. Practice by stepping on with your soul foot first, then place your front foot on after. Most of your weight should evenly on your <a href="#diagram">soul plate</a>. Once mastered it's one of the easier tricks to balance for longer grinds.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="acid-soul.gif" loading="lazy" id="acid-soul">
          <h2>Acid Soul Grind</h2>
          <p>Similar to a <a href="#soul-grind">soul grind</a>, but your front foot is angeled with the inside of the front foot open. Rely on your soul foot to be solid before trying this one.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="mizou.gif" loading="lazy" id="mizou">
            <h2>Mizou</h2>
            <p>This is another good starter soul trick. Start with more weight on your soul plate and get comfortable with your back foot on the <a href="#diagram">h-block</a>. Lean your soul plate on top of the rail and put more weight on the back foot. Stretch out your stance for more balance.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="makio.gif" loading="lazy" id="makio">
            <h2>Makio</h2>
            <p>When you're mastered the basic soul tricks try this classic one footed trick. The key to holding the grab is leaning over on your soul foot while bending your knees and holding your foot up toward you.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="pornstar.gif" loading="lazy" id="pornstar">
            <h2>Pornstar</h2>
            <p>Silly name, but a fun trick. After mastering the <a href="#makio">Makio</a> this trick should come fairly easy. It's easiest if most of your weight is on your soul foot. Cross your back foot behind you - resting on the <a href="#diagram">backlslide plate</a> and <a href="#diagram">h-block</a>. Also commonly called "p-star" grind.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="mistrial.gif" loading="lazy" id="mistrial">
            <h2>Mistrial</h2>
            <p>The stylish version of the <a href="#mizou">mizou</a> - and only different by leaning the back foot on the <a href="#diagram">backslide plate</a>. This trick looks great if you bend your knees to keep the back foot nice and angeled. Some prefer to do this with the other soul foot to take advantage of a stronger <a href="#backslide">backslide</a> foot.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="x-grind.gif" loading="lazy" id="x-grind">
            <h2>X-Grind</h2>
            <p>Keep both soul feet inline and lock both <a href="#diagram">soul plates</a> on either side of the rail. Stay completely on top of the rail to better balance. Some prefer to have their "natural" or "non-switch" soul foot in front, some prefer behind.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="backslide.gif" loading="lazy" id="backslide">
            <h2>Backslide</h2>
            <p>Another classic trick but a bit more advanced than the previous ones. Once you're comfortabe with <a href="#royale">royales</a> try lifting your front foot and grabbing it. The only contact point is your <a href="#diagram">h-block</a> and <a href="#diagram">backslide plate</a>, so it can be hard to hold for longer grinds. To learn this trick try using more speed and just grind the end of the rail at first.</p>

          <div class="column">
            <img src="backside-torque.gif" loading="lazy" id="backside-torque">
            <h2>Backside Torque</h2>
            <p>After mastering the <a href="#backside-full-torque">backside full torque</a>, try putting more weight on your front foot until you can hold it comfortably with one foot. Then jump all your weight balanced between the <a href="#diagram">h-block</a> and <a href="#diagram">backslide plate</a>. Extra steezy if you grab it too (I should have).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="frontside-torque.gif" loading="lazy" id="front-torque">
            <h2>Frontside Torque</h2>
            <p>Although very similar to the <a href="#backside-torque">backside torque</a> some find this trick incredibly easier or harder, depending on comfort and familiarity. The key to this trick is to be fully commited and centered on top. If you slip back as you're learning it just default to a <a href="#front-full-torque">front full torque</a> to save yourself from falling off the rail.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="alley-oop-soul.gif" loading="lazy" id="alley-oop-soul">
            <h2>Alley-Oop Soul Grind</h2>
            <p>Basically <a href="#soul-grind">soul grind</a> but backwards, or "alley-oop". It helps to lead with the toe of your <a href="#diagram">soul plate</a>, and then balance right on top of the rail with your heel down. The back foot will follow.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="soyale.gif" loading="lazy" id="soyale">
            <h2>Soyale</h2>
            <p>Very similar to an alley-oop soul grind but with the back foot angeled in to lock in your <a href="#diagram">backslide plate</a>. Bend your knees more to make the stance easier. Many like to soyale with their natural backslide foot and switch (less strong) soul foot, like me here.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="alley-oop-acid-soul.gif" loading="lazy" id="alley-oop-acid-soul">
            <h2>Alley-Oop Acid Soul Grind</h2>
            <p>Once you've mastered the <a href="#alley-oop-soul">alley-oop soul</a>, try angeling your back foot into the acid position - resting on the <a href="#diagram">backslide plate</a> and <a href="#diagram">h-block</a>. You'll need to keep most of your weight on the soul foot to better balance this one.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="alley-oop-pornstar.gif" loading="lazy" id="alley-oop-pornstar">
            <h2>Alley-Oop Pornstar</h2>
            <p>Also similar to the <a href="#alley-oop-soul">alley-oop soul</a>, but lead with your crossed foot down the rail resting on the <a href="#diagram">backslide plate</a> and <a href="#diagram">h-block</a>. It may seem like a complicated position but your back foot will usually hug your heel pretty easily. To balance keep most of your weight on your soul foot and stay on top of the rail.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="alley-oop-makio.gif" loading="lazy" id="alley-oop-makio">
            <h2>Alley-Oop Makio</h2>
            <p>Once you've got more confidence holding your alley-oop tricks try this backward one-footed trick. It's harder to balance but feels amazing when you hold it. Lead with your toe to lock on the soul foot and then lock down your heel to balance down the rail. Don't lean too hard on the heel otherwise you'll fall back. When comfortable, grab your other foot with your fingers roughly in the middle of the <a href="#diagram">soul plate</a>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="alley-oop-mizou.gif" loading="lazy" id="alley-oop-mizou">
            <h2>Alley-Oop Mizou</h2>
            <p>Spin backward and stretch your non-soul foot around your body facing forward in front of you, in the <a href="#mizou">mizou</a> position (but backwards). Some think this trick feels similar to a 270 backside royale, some think it's similar to an alley-oop makio. Keep your hips facing perpendicular to the rail to help from continuing to spin.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="alley-oop-mistrial.gif" loading="lazy" id="alley-oop-mistrial">
            <h2>Alley-Oop Mistrial</h2>
            <p>Similar to the <a href="#alley-oop-mizou">alley-oop mizou</a> but angle your front foot inward and on the <a href="#diagram">backslide plate</a>, in the <a href="#mistrial">mistrial</a> position (but backwards). It helps to turn your hips earlier to keep them pointed roughly perpendicular to the rail. Avoid continuing to spin all the way around as it makes it harder to hold this trick.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="alley-oop-x-grind.gif" loading="lazy" id="alley-oop-x-grind">
            <h2>Alley-Oop X-Grind</h2>
            <p>Once you've mastered the forward x-grind try it backwards - both feet locked in on the soul plates going backwards on the rail. First try stalling this trick to see which foot should be leading down the rail. Some put more weight on their front foot, some on the back foot. It's probably most common to treat this like an <a href="#alley-oop-soul">alley-oop soul</a> and turn your back foot a bit more to lock in the soul foot.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="topsoul.gif" loading="lazy" id="topsoul">
            <h2>Topsoul</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite tricks, the topsoul is just a more difficult version of the soul grind. Jump on the top or "topside" of the rail, meaning your soul foot wheels cross over the rail to the other side. You'll need to land with your soul foot locked in the back and your foot foot resting on the <a href="#diagram">h-block</a> in the front - at the same time and evenly balanced. The key to balancing this is staying right on top of the rail.</p>
          </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="topside-acid.gif" loading="lazy" id="topside-acid">
          <h2>Topside Acid</h2>
          <p>Similar to the <a href="#acid-soul">acid soul grind</a> but jumping on topside instead. Most prefer to move their topside foot right under their body to maintain that open stance. Some also lead with the front foot to help guide the trick.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="sweatstance.gif" loading="lazy" id="sweatstance">
            <h2>Sweatstance</h2>
            <p>Once you've mastered the <a href="#mizou">mizou</a> and <a href="#front-full-torque">front full torque</a> this should feel familiar. Jump right on top with both feet equally balanced. Your front foot will be on the topside soul plate and the back foot on your h-block. If you put too much weight on the front soul foot you'll likely lift the back foot off. Style this one out by bending your knees and getting super low.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="topside-pornstar.gif" loading="lazy" id="topside-pornstar">
            <h2>Topside Pornstar</h2>
            <p>Once you've mastered the <a href="#pornstar">pornstar grind</a>, try it topside. Keep most of your weight on your front foot with the soul plate topside, and cross the back foot behind your heel on the <a href="#diagram">h-block</a> and <a href="#diagram">backslide plate</a>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="fishbrain.gif" loading="lazy" id="fishbrain">
            <h2>Fishbrain</h2>
            <p>Similar to a <a href="#makio">makio</a>, but with a lot more weight on your ankle since it's topside. You'll need to lean right on top of the rail with more weight on your frame to balance it. One way to ease into learning it is to jump almost straight onto the rail. Then move over a bit further as you're jumping on to help you stay topside. Then grab your foot and hold it up higher for more steezee</p>

        <div class="column">
          <img src="frontside-unity.gif" loading="lazy" id="frontside-unity">
          <h2>Frontside Unity</h2>
          <p>Another classic from the 90s, the frontside unity is a really cool feeling trick. Most have a dominant foot to help them balance - for me it's my front foot since I <a href="#royale">royale</a> with it. Try stalling this on a curb a bunch of times before hitting the rail. It can be a weird feeling to have your feet crossed at first.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="backside-unity.gif" loading="lazy" id="backside-unity">
          <h2>Backside Unity</h2>
          <p>Similar to the <a href="#frontside-unity">frontside unity</a> but backside (or behind you) - which changes the feeling of trick entirely. I put more weight on my <a href="#backside-torque">backside torque<a> and use that to save myself if I miss.</p>

          <p>If you felt really comfortable with the <a href="#frontside-unity">unity</a>, or <a href="#alley-oop-pornstar">alley-oop pornstar</a>, this trick might be a good one to try next. The key is keeping evenly balanced and use your dominant foot to help you jump onto it the first few times. This is often called a "savannah" depending on where you're from.</p>

          <h2>Alley-Oop Backside Unity</h2>
          <p>If you feel comfortable with all the other unity tricks, try this one next. The tough part is wrapping your front foot all the way around your body. Again, take advantage of your dominant foot from either the <a href="#backslide">backslide</a> (for the front foot) or <a href="#backside-torque">back torque</a> (for the back foot). Also often called a "truespin savannah" or "backside savannah" depending on where you're from.</p>

          <p>Instead of alley-oop <a href="#sweatstance">sweatstance</a>, or alley-oop topside <a href="#mizou">mizou</a>, this trick got it's own name. This is probably the easiest alley-oop topside grind to get you started. It's very similar to a <a href="#royale">frontside royale<a>, but just turn your foot and lock in the alley-oop topside foot.</p>

          <p>Very similar to the <a href="#kindgrind">kindgrind</a>, but angle your front foot inward on your <a href="#diagram">backslide plate</a>. Some prefer to do this with their less strong or "switch" soul foot so they can use their <a href="#front-torque">front torque</a> foot to guide them.</p>

          <p>This trick is a unique feeling one - but can be helpful to try after mastering the <a href="#kindgrind">kindgrind</a> or <a href="#alley-oop-fishbrain">alley-oop fishbrain</a>. Most of your weight will be on your back soul foot and balanced right on top with your legs crossed. It helps to tuck your back foot against the heel of your soul foot for balance.</p>

          <p>After jumping turn your hips to point backward, and land on your topside soul foot balanced right on top of the rail. If you don't turn enough it'll be hard to stay on top of the rail, if you continue turning it'll be hard to hold. I find it easier to put more weight on the toe at first rather than the heel. Grabbing this trick often forces you to commit, and of course looks way sicker.</p>

          <p>A similar feeling to the <a href="#alley-oop-topsoul">alley-oop topsoul</a>, but land with your back foot open and on the outide of the <a href="#diagram">h-block</a>. Some find this much easier than the <a href="#alley-oop-topsoul">alley-oop topsoul</a> because it feels more natural to turn your front foot this way.

          <p>Much like the <a href="#alley-oop-topsoul">alley-oop topsoul</a>, but spin the other way and inward or "truespin". This trick might feel weird at first since your soul foot is turned inward. Most prefer to guide this trick with the toe of their soul foot first, then lock the heel down and balance it out. Your back foot can be helpful to save yourself if you miss the soul foot.</p>

          <h2>Truespin Topside Pornstar</h2>
          <p>After feeling comfortable with other truespin topside tricks, try wrapping your non-soul foot around the back of your topside soul foot. It helps to be very confident with the topside soul foot. Practice by stalling first, then be sure to approach with enough speed to comfortably slide. If on a rail, it's easier to learn by approaching straight on. It helps reduce the angle you'll have to spin.</p>

          <h2>Truespin Fishbrain</h2>
          <p>Probably the toughest truespin topside tricks - this will turn heads every time you lace it. Approach it similar to the <a href="#tru-topside-pornstar">true top p-star</a>, but since all your weight is on one foot you'll want to be evenly balanced on top of the one foot. Spin over top of the rail and land with your hips squarely pointing backward. Try not to keep spinning otherwise it'll be hard to hold the trick.</p>

Think of it like a <a href="#backside-royale">backside royale</a>, but continue turning your soul foot and open your stance up to lock that soul foot in place.</p>

          <p>Similar to the <a href="tru-mizou">tru mizou</a> but feels quite different with the back foot turned and crossed the other way. Practice by stalling but keep in mind that with any spinning tricks they feel much different when moving. Guide with your <a href="tru-soul">truespin soul</a> foot and turn entirely backward. At first you'll find it's easier to lock your soul foot first, then slap the back crossed foot down afterward.</p>

You may find it's much safer to attempt since you can use your other foot to save yourself, but balancing it is much harder. Make sure you have even weight on the toe and heel of your soul foot to hold this one longer.</p>

          <p>Being one of the harder truespin tricks, you'll need to spin around trusting your blind spot. Pay attention to how close you are to the rail for this one. You may find that being closer and cutting down on the angle you need to spin makes it much easier. To balance longer put a bit more weight on your soul foot.</p>

          <p>If this is your introduction to negative tricks -  you'll be amazed to hear that all soul tricks have a version on the inside or "negative" part of the boot. I don't do a lot of negative tricks but I find this one to be fun and cool looking. Some find it easier to do this trick the same way they <a href="#royale">royale</a> to take avantage of the stronger <a href="#backslide">backslide</a> foot. Remember that negative souls are much smaller so you'll need to lean over a bit more to balance this one.</p>

Try to land on top of the rail and balance your one foot evenly on the <a href="#diagram">h-block</a> between your middle wheels. Save yourself by putting down your back foot as you're learning this one. Try lifting your back foot higher to steeze it out for some more style points.</p>
